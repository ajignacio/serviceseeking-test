## Task
   Build a to-do list.

## Use Cases
    As a user, when I visit the home page, I should be able to see:
  
    - a responsive page written in bootstrap;
    - a form to insert to-do list items;
    - a navigation bar with the following links:
      - home; and
      - to-do list.
      
  **As a user**, when I add a to-do list item and click "save", I should see a page with my to-do list.
  
  **As a user**, when I visit the to-do list page and I click "edit", I should see the edit form of the to-do list.
  
  **As a user**, when I visit the edit page of my to-do list, update my to-do list item and click "update", I should  see my to-do list with the updated item.
  
  **As a user**, when I visit the to-do list page and I click "delete", I should be asked to confirm my deletion.
  
  **As a user**, when I visit the to-do list page and I click "delete" and confirm the deletion, my to-do list item should be deleted and I should be redirected to the index page of to-do items.


##What we are looking for##
  The purpose of this test is to determine your depth of knowledge across the full stack as well as your experience in writing manageable and modular code.  Depending on your level of experience, some of the things we will be assessing are:
  
1. **Basic MVC** - Should practically demonstrate the relationship between models views and controllers
2. **Database design** (stick to relational i.e. mysql or postgres)
3. **Use of trailblazer** - It's a framework we use within our Rails app. (https://github.com/apotonick/trailblazer)
4. **Use of cells** - Part of the trailblazer framework. (https://github.com/apotonick/cells)
5. **Engines** - We have plenty
6. **Slim** - Our templating engine
7. **jQuery**
8. **Bootstrap**
9. **Responsive design**
10. **Rspec**


## Your aim ##
Try to achieve as many of the points above as you can.  It's also an opportunity to show off your strengths.  Feel free to introduce anything that makes us go, "wow" even if it goes beyond the scope of the use cases.  You're welcome to add gems; in some cases above you'll have to anyway.


## Timing ##
You have two days to complete the task.


## Test Submission ##
1. Fork this repo.
2. Pull your version and write theyour code.
3. When the code is completed, submit a pull request against our Service Seeking's version.
4. We will review your code and will get in touch with you after that.
